h3. About

p. iFilger is a very minimal buff/debuff tracking addon that will allow you to track buffs/debuffs on yourself, target, pets, focus, etc, and also can be used to track cooldowns.

p. Buffs/debuffs/cooldowns/internal-cooldown can be displayed as both bars and icons, and stack sizes and durations will be shown.

p. Only the buffs/debuffs/cooldowns you want will be displayed, the addon uses a white-list system and you have to tell it exactly what you want it to show. 

p. The default config is VERY bar/icon spammy, you'll probably want to go through and comment out a bunch of stuff for a usable setup.

h3. What's next ? 

p. I've in mind to make config a little more easier coz now, i need to keep update both version (stand alone and not).
I may try to make iFilger_config seperate to the addon so it doesn't depend on which version you want to use (stand alone or not).

h3. WARNING

p. It seams the memory used by the addon still increase slowly during long fight and come back to normal value at the end. There may be a small memory leak and i can't find that b**** again >_<
